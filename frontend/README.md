# Project Management and Workflow
## Planning
We used Trello to guide our project plan and define sprints. Each task was assigned to team members with clear deadlines and priorities.

## Sprint Challenges
During the sprint, we encountered difficulties due to some team members' absences. This affected our ability to complete the header and sign-in page on time. Consequently, we had to revise our workflow to accommodate these challenges and ensure timely project completion.
